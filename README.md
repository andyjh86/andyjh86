# Hi, I'm Andy 👋

Welcome to my GitHub.  
This isn’t a developer portfolio — it’s my **personal knowledge base**.

I work primarily across **ICT projects, business analysis, and digital transformation**, and I use this GitHub as a space to organise the technical things I learn along the way. Coding is a **hobby**, I am not a developer and it is not the centre of my career, but it dooes the work I do across systems, architecture, automation, and problem-solving.

## 🌱 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub mainly contains:

- Small **experiments** in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages I’m exploring  
- **Reference snippets** and reusable notes  
- **Lessons learned** from personal projects and home-lab builds  
- Documentation I keep for future problem-solving  
- Occasional tests of tools, frameworks, or ideas I’m curious about  

It’s essentially my **technical scrapbook** — a place to store anything I may want to revisit later.

## 🧠 Why I Use GitHub This Way

My day-to-day work involves designing, delivering, and supporting ICT solutions, not writing production-grade software.  
Even so, I enjoy understanding the technologies that sit underneath the systems I work with.

GitHub helps me:

- Keep track of how things work under the hood  
- Document patterns, fixes, and approaches I’ve learned  
- Maintain a central place for scripts, notes, and small proofs-of-concept  
- Support my continuous learning mindset  

If something in here is helpful to someone else - great success.  
But the main purpose of this space is **learning, exploring, and placing my (sometimes incoherent)**.

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration (Casually)

If you see something interesting, feel free to reach out.  
I’m always happy to chat about ICT projects, digital transformation, home-lab setups, or anything technical I may have dabbled in here.

## 📌 A Final Note

Because this is a learning space, the code here is intentionally simple.  

If you're viewing this profile as a recruiter or hiring manager:  
**please treat this as a reference library, not a showcase of my professional project delivery work.**

Thanks for stopping by.
