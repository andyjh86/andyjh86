- 👋 Hi, I’m @andyjh86
- 👀 I’m interested in conversational chat bots, machine learning & self hosting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~~python~~ ~~nodejs & javascript~~ C# and server networking (C# is a lie but the intent is there)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything ~~that will teach me something new~~. **literally anything**
- 📫 How to reach me ... Best to follow me on here. I try to keep online and IRL separate.
- 💾 I'm currently using this as a place to store examples I've learned about. ~~**Full disclosure: ~~I have no idea what I'm doing~~ I am stil learning.**
- 📝 I mainly use my GitHub as a cheat sheet, but it does tell a story of my learning journey.

<sub>The cringe sets in every time I look at my old code and I die a little on the inside... That means I'm getting better right?</sub>
