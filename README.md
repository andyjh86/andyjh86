- 👋 Hi, I’m @andyjh86
- 👀 I’m interested in conversational chat bots, machine learning & self hosting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~~python~~ ~~nodejs & javascript~~ C# and server networking (C# is a lie but the intent is there)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything ~~that will teach me something new~~. **literally anything**
- 📫 How to reach me ... I don't know, follow me on here. Interact with my repositories and I'll probably follow you
- 💾 I'm currently using this as a place to store examples I've learned about. ~~**Full disclosure: ~~I have no idea what I'm doing~~ I am stil learning.**
- 📝 I use this as a cheat sheet most of the time, but figure I might as well use it to document my learning journey.

~The cringe sets in every time I look at my old code and I die a little on the inside... That means I'm getting better right?~
